          <p>
            My name is <strong>Patrick Quach</strong> I have
            <strong>lived here <em>all</em> my life</strong>. Sadly I haven't
            been able to travel much and with the start of this program this
            probably won't change for a while. I typically spend most of my time
            indoors <strong>playing games on my computer</strong>. I have never
            taken this heavy of a courseload before but I hope I will be able to
            come out of this unscathed.

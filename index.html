        <p>
          My name is <strong>Patrick Quach</strong> I have
          <strong>lived here <em>all</em> my life</strong>. Sadly I haven't been
          able to travel much and with the start of this program this probably
          won't change for a while. I typically spend most of my time indoors
          <strong>playing games on my computer</strong>. I have never taken this
          heavy of a courseload before but I hope I will be able to come out of
          this unscathed.

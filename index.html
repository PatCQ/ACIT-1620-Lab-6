    <h2>about me:</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Patrick Quach</strong> I have
      <strong>lived here <em>all</em> my life</strong>. Sadly I haven't been
      able to travel much and with the start of this program this probably won't
      change for a while. I typically spend most of my time indoors
      <strong>playing games on my computer</strong>. I have never taken this
      heavy of a courseload before but I hope I will be able to come out of this
      unscathed.
